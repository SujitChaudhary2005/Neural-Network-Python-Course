    "## Classify vs. Predict\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Understanding Predictors**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we built a **predictor**. A predictor takes an **input value** and produces a **numerical output**. For example, when converting kilometers to miles, the model used a linear function with an adjustable parameter to predict the correct number of miles. The prediction improved by **adjusting the internal parameter** based on the error between the predicted value and the known correct value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of model focuses on predicting *how much* of something there is.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Introducing Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we explore a different task: **classification**. Instead of predicting a numerical value, a classifier decides **which group something belongs to**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a dataset showing the **widths and lengths of garden bugs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Dataset to be classified](../images/Dataset%20to%20be%20classified.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the graph, two distinct groups are visible:\n",
    "- **Caterpillars** are long and thin\n",
    "- **Ladybugs** are short and wide\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not to predict a number, but to **separate these two groups correctly**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using a Linear Function for Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we used a linear function to convert one number into another. A key property of a linear function is that it forms a **straight line when plotted**. The slope of this line is controlled by an adjustable parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using the line to calculate values, we can use it as a **dividing boundary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Prediction using a separating line](../images/Prediction%20using%20a%20separating%20line.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a straight line can separate caterpillars from ladybugs, then it can be used to **classify unknown bugs** based on their measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the first line shown does not separate the groups correctly. Many caterpillars appear on the same side of the line as ladybugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Adjusting the Line**\n",
    "\n",
    "By changing the **slope of the line**, we change how the data is divided.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Adjusting the slope](../images/Adjusting%20the%20slope.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some adjustments make the separation worse. This demonstrates that **not all parameter values produce useful classifiers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "After further adjustment, a much better line appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bug classifier](../images/Bug%20classifier.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This line cleanly separates caterpillars from ladybugs. Once this happens, the line becomes a **working classifier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Classifying Unknown Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a classifier is trained, it can be used on **new, unseen data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Classifying an unknown bug](../images/Classifying%20an%20unknown%20bug.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a new bug’s measurements place it above the line, it can be classified as a caterpillar. If it falls below, it is classified as a ladybug. This assumes only the two known bug types exist, which is acceptable for illustrating the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why This Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson shows that the **same linear function** used for prediction can also be used for **classification**, depending on how it is applied. The critical challenge is **finding the right slope** so the line separates data correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "How we adjust that slope and improve poor separations is the central idea behind **how neural networks learn**.\n"
