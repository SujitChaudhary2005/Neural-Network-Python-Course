    "## Estimate the Constant Iteratively\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Introduction to Iterative Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world problems, we often **do not know the exact formula** that connects inputs to outputs. Instead of solving problems in a single step using algebra, we can take a different approach: **guess, measure how wrong we are, and improve the guess step by step**. This process is called **iterative estimation**, and it forms the foundation of how **neural networks learn**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than aiming for perfection immediately, iterative learning focuses on **gradual improvement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Making an Initial Guess**\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a simple linear model:\n",
    "\n",
    "**miles = kilometers × c**\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of **c** is unknown. Instead of solving it mathematically, we **guess a value** and see how well it performs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s begin with:\n",
    "\n",
    "**c = 0.5**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Calculating the constant c](../images/Calculating%20the%20constant%20c.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this guess with `kilometers = 100`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**calculated miles = 100 × 0.5 = 50**\n",
    "\n",
    "But the correct value is **62.137 miles**. This means our guess is wrong, and we need a way to measure *how wrong* it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Understanding Error**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **error** tells us the difference between the truth and our calculated value:\n",
    "\n",
    "**error = truth − calculated**\n",
    "\n",
    "So,\n",
    "\n",
    "**error = 62.137 − 50 = 12.137**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Calculating the error when c=0.5](../images/Calculating%20the%20error%20when%20c=0.5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This positive error tells us something important:\n",
    "- Our output is **too small**\n",
    "- We need to **increase the value of c**\n",
    "\n",
    "Error is not failure. It is **information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Refining the Guess**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the error as guidance, we nudge the constant upward:\n",
    "\n",
    "**c = 0.6**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now:\n",
    "\n",
    "**100 × 0.6 = 60**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Calculating the error when c=0.6](../images/Calculating%20the%20error%20when%20c=0.6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The new error is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**62.137 − 60 = 2.137**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **much smaller error**, meaning our model has improved. Encouragingly, we are moving in the right direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overshooting and Correction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s push further:\n",
    "\n",
    "**c = 0.7**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Overshooting the correct answer when c=0.7](../images/Overshooting%20the%20correct%20answer%20when%20c=0.7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the output becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**100 × 0.7 = 70**\n",
    "\n",
    "The error is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**62.137 − 70 = −7.863**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **negative error** indicates that we **overshot** the correct value. This teaches us an important lesson:\n",
    "- Bigger nudges can cause instability\n",
    "- As we get closer, adjustments should be **smaller and more careful**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Fine-Tuning the Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s make a smaller adjustment:\n",
    "\n",
    "**c = 0.61**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Calculating the error when c=0.61](../images/Calculating%20the%20error%20when%20c=0.61.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now:\n",
    "\n",
    "**100 × 0.61 = 61**\n",
    "\n",
    "The error is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**62.137 − 61 = 1.137**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is our **best result so far**. The model is converging toward the correct value by making **small, controlled improvements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why This Is Neural Network Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "What we have just done mirrors **how neural networks are trained**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with random parameters\n",
    "- Measure the error\n",
    "- Adjust parameters based on error\n",
    "- Repeat until performance improves\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is called **iterative learning**. Unlike traditional math problems solved in one step, neural networks **learn gradually** by refining their parameters through experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points**\n",
    "\n",
    "* All intelligent systems follow **input → calculation → output**\n",
    "* When formulas are unknown, models with adjustable parameters are used\n",
    "* **Error guides learning**, not exact equations\n",
    "* Large errors need larger corrections; small errors need gentle adjustments\n",
    "* Iterative refinement is the **core mechanism behind neural network training**\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson marks a crucial shift in thinking: **intelligence is not programmed directly, it is learned through repeated improvement**.\n"
