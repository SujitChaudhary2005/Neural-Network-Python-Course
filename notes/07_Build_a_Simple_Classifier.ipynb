    "## Build a Simple Linear Classifier (Ladybugs vs Caterpillars)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson focuses on building a **simple linear classifier** that can distinguish between two types of bugs, ladybugs and caterpillars, using their **width** and **length**. The goal is to understand how a straight line can act as a **dividing boundary** between two groups of data points and how adjusting the **slope** of that line affects classification performance. This process lays the groundwork for how neural networks are trained using example data.\n",

    "### What Is a Linear Classifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear classifier uses a **straight line** to separate data into different categories. In this case, the classifier separates bugs into two groups based on their physical measurements. Unlike a predictor that converts one value into another, the line here does not predict length from width. Instead, it simply acts as a **decision boundary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier uses the linear equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "y = Ax\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `x` and `y` represent the axes of the graph (width and length).\n",
    "* `A` is a parameter that controls the **slope** of the line.\n",
    "* Changing `A` changes how steep the line is, which directly affects how well it separates the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simpler form `y = Ax` is used intentionally. Adding a constant term (`B` in `y = Ax + B`) would shift the line away from the origin, which does not add value in this simplified scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the classifier, we use **examples we know to be true**, called **training data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Example | Width | Length | Bug         |\n",
    "| ------- | ----- | ------ | ----------- |\n",
    "| 1       | 3.0   | 1.0    | Ladybug     |\n",
    "| 2       | 1.0   | 3.0    | Caterpillar |\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples represent known measurements and labels. The classifier uses this information to refine the slope of the dividing line.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Important concept:**\n",
    "Training data is essential because it provides **ground truth** that guides how the classifier should behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizing the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting the training data helps make patterns easier to see than reading numbers in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Training data for classifying bugs](../images/Training%20data%20for%20classifying%20bugs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization reveals that ladybugs and caterpillars occupy different regions of the graph, making them suitable for separation by a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trying an Initial Dividing Line\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, a random slope is chosen:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "A = 0.25\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the dividing line:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "y = 0.25x\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "![Classifying bugs](../images/Classifying%20bugs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the plot, it is immediately clear that this line does **not** correctly separate the two bug types. Both the ladybug and the caterpillar lie on the same side of the line, making the classifier ineffective.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "The failure of this initial line shows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **slope matters**\n",
    "* A poor slope leads to incorrect classification\n",
    "* Simply drawing a good-looking line by eye is not acceptable\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, what is needed is a **repeatable process**, or **algorithm**, that adjusts the slope based on training data rather than intuition. This idea is central to how classifiers and neural networks learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* A linear classifier uses a straight line to separate data into categories\n",
    "* Training data provides known examples that guide learning\n",
    "* The slope of the line determines classification accuracy\n",
    "* Visualization helps identify whether a classifier works\n",
    "* Finding the correct slope requires an algorithmic approach, not guesswork\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson establishes the basic mechanics behind training classifiers, which directly connects to how neural networks refine internal parameters during learning.\n"
